# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through boot camp pre-work. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The bullet points were the most important things to note as I was going through the pre-work. I learned basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned how to manage version control using git and gitHub. This study guide is not completely comprehensive and is designed only to show the basics of the subjects in the bootcamp pre-work.
